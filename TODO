* storing loading of models to and from files
* collect log-likelihoods and write to file
* dump log to file in output prefix
* use something like libmagic to figure out file types
* write out version information into log
* load and use multiple data sets simultaneously by taking either
 - the intersection of genes, or
 - the union of genes
* option to only use the top n genes
* note that some sums across factors, genes, and / or spots may yield numbers greater than 2^16; however the count data type uses 32 bit! So this should be unproblematic
