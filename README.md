This is code to perform Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference for the
Spatial Transcriptome Deconvolution model.

In order to compile it, you need two libraries:
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)

The Boost library needs to be at least version 1.58.0 because it was only in this version that the trigamma function (i.e. the curvature, or second derivative, of the gamma function) was introduced.

Compiling
=========
You build and install the code as follows.
Note that ```<INSTALL_PREFIX>``` is a path below which the program will be installed.
This could be e.g. ```$HOME/local``` to install into a user-local prefix.

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<INSTALL_PREFIX>
make
make install
```

Note that ```<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin``` and ```<INSTALL_PREFIX>/lib``` have to be included in your ```PATH``` and ```LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` environment variables, respectively.

To do this you have to have lines like the following

```sh
export PATH=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<INSTALL_PREFIX>/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

to your ```$HOME/.bashrc``` file (or similar in case you are a shell other than bash).
